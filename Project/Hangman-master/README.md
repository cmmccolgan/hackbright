# Hangman

This is a terminal version of the classic game of Hangman! Most of the notes for the game/code are in the code file in comments, and the game isntructions should be self-explanatory, or visible while playing the game. To make this work, you should have the NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit - http://www.nltk.org/) installed so that the words can be drawn from the Brown Corpus. After this is done (and python is installed), just navigate to the directory with hangman.py and type "python hangman.py" into the terminal!
